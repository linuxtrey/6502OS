The name is pretty self-explainable, its a cli based system for the 6502OS.
It's going to be pretty basic. As you can tell, there is nothing right this minute.
I would love some help with it. I would also like a mentor and a teacher for 6502 assembly.
My best teacher right now for 6502 ASM is google and youtube.
Thanks for even looking at this crap!
